<h1>Reuse of an Affinity Chromatography Column</h1>

<h2>Experiment Description:</h2>
My project involved working with an Akta system that had affinity chromatography columns. A chromatography column is a glass cylinder with resin inside that is composed of tiny beads packed into a bed. The goal of my project was to find a regeneration buffer that cleaned any impurities from the column after experiments so that it could be recycled. This would not only reduce material waste but also scientists' time in packing the columns. 
The way I did this was by Design of Experiment, testing six different regeneration buffers and adjusting variables like flow rate and column volumes in order to analyze which buffer cleaned the column the best. The way this was tested was through UV readings using a SoloVPE machine, these are directly correlated to protein concentrations which is a way to detect product in a sample.

<h2>Project Conclusion:</h2>
Although the exact composition of the regeneration buffer is confidential, I was able to develop a process that cleaned affinity columns and allowed for 10 more experiment runs to be done on them. This at manufacturing scale saved the company around $50,000 per run.
